    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Genesis Surlin. One goal I am working towards is getting to be able to run track at the collegiate level. When it comes to doing something professionally I would like to go to college and study psychology and leave with at least a master's degree. I want to be able to help people but mainly athletes who suffer from mental health issues. One way I can work towards these goals is to study hard and maintain my focus through school. I will also keep my grades up and do every workout to my full potential. Some values I consider most necessary for my success are not stressing, staying organized, having a set schedule, and fitting in time for myself. Some Short-term goals I hope to accomplish would be getting faster and breaking another high school record. Finally, some character traits I'd most likely want to be known for are my kindness, my will to help others in need, how ambitious I am when it comes to things that I really care about, and my passion for track and field.

 

 

Thank you :)</p>
